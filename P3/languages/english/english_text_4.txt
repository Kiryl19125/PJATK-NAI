The United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are among the major English-speaking countries known as the "Anglophone world." While each country has its own unique dialects and accents, they share a common linguistic heritage rooted in the English language. This shared linguistic bond fosters cultural exchange and collaboration among English-speaking nations.

English is also the official language of many international organizations, including the United Nations, the European Union, and the World Health Organization. This global prominence further solidifies English as a lingua franca for diplomacy, trade, and cooperation on the world stage.
